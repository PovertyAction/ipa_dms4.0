net install ipacheck, from("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PovertyAction/ipadms4.0/final") replace
ipacheck update

* after initial installation ipacheck can be updated at any time via
ipacheck update

* to start a new project with folder structure and input files
ipacheck new, surveys("SURVEY_NAME_1") folder("path/to/project")

* when starting a new project with multiple surveys, you can choose to use the subfolders option to create subfolders for each survey
ipacheck new, surveys("SURVEY_NAME_1" "SURVEY_NAME_2") folder("path/to/project") subfolders

* to obtain fresh copies of the master do-file and Excel inputs without creating the folder structure
ipacheck new, filesonly

* to go through IPA's exercise with instructions, exercise data, and folder structure with input files
ipacheck new, exercise 

* to verify you have the latest versions of the commands
