{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:ipacheckoutliers} checks for outliers in numeric survey variables. 

{title:Options}

{dlgtab:Main}

{phang}
{opt sheet("sheetname")} specifies the Excel worksheet to load from the {help using} file. This is required if the using file is {opt .xls} or {opt .xlsx} formats. option {opt sheet()} is ignored if the using file is {opt .csv} or {opt .dta} file.

{pstd}
{opt id(varname)} specifies the id variable for the dataset. {cmd:id()} is required 
and the variable specified with {cmd:id()} must contain unique values only. 
The id variable is automatically included in the output.

{pstd}
{opth enumerator(varname)} specifies the enumerator variable for the dataset. {cmd:enumerator()} is 
required and is automatically included in the output. 

{pstd}
{opt date(varname)} specifies the date or datetime variable indicating the date of 
survey. Reommended variables are Survey start, end or submission dates. This option 
expects a %td date variable or a %tc/%tC datetime variable. If variable specified 
is a datetime variable, the output will show the correspondent date instead of 
datetime. {cmd:date()} is required. 

{pstd}
{opt outfile("filename.xlsx")} specifies Excel workbook to export the duplicate report into. 
{cmd:outfile()} is required. Excel formats xls and xlsx are supported in {cmd:outfile()}. 
If a file extension is not specified with {cmd:outfile()}, .xls is assumed, because 
this format is more common and is compatible with more applications that also can read from Excel files.

{dlgtab:Specifications}

{pstd}
{opt outsheet("sheetname")} specifies the Excel worksheet Excel sheet to export the 
output to for the {opt outfile()} specified. The default is to save to Excel sheet "outliers".

{pstd}
{opt sheetmodify} specifies that the output sheet should only be modified 
but not be replaced if it already exist.  

{pstd}
{opt sheetreplace} specifies that the output sheet should be replaced if 
it already exist.  

{pstd}
{opt nolabel} nolabel exports the underlying numeric values instead of the value labels.

{title:Remarks}

{pstd}
{cmd:ipacheckoutliers} is one of the checks run in IPA's Data Management System. 
It can be run within IPA's Data Management System, where inputs are entered into an Excel inputs sheet 
and outputs are formatted in a .xlsx file or used directly from the command window 
or other do-files. See {help ipacheck} for more details on how to use the 
Data Management System. 

{pstd}
Below, an example {opt inputs file} is shown with additional optional variables:
The variabels {cmd:variable}, {cmd:by}, {cmd:method}, {cmd:multiplier}, {cmd:combine} and {cmd:keepvars} are required. The inputs file may also include additional variables which contain information that are useful for tracking, although these additional variables will not be used.

{pstd}
{opt variable} column/variable stores the variable to check for outliers. This column only accepts a {help varlist}. The variables specified in this column must be a numeric variable and {cmd:ipacheckoutliers} will return an error if it is not. The variable column is required.  

{pstd}
{opt by} column/variable stores the by variable. The {opt by} variables when specifies indicates that values for outliers and should be calculated by groups specified by the values in the {opt by} variables. This coloumn is useful if are generally expected to be different between groups eg. treatment status, gender or location. This column only accepts a {help varname}. The {opt by} variable accepts any type of variable, however, the variable must not contain any missing values and {cmd:ipacheckoutliers} will return an error if missing values are found for the {opt by} variable specified. Default is to flag outliers considering all values in specified for each variable in the {opt variable} column.

{pstd}
{opt method} column/variable stores the method for calculating outliers for the variables specified in the corresponding {opt variables} column. {cmd:ipacheckoutliers} calculates outliers by using the inter-quartile range or the sd. Users can specify if the method to apply by indication {opt iqr} for the inter-quartile range or {opt sd} for standard deviation. The default method is iqr. 

{pstd}
{opt multiplier} column/variable stores the multiplier to use when calculating the outliers for the variables specified in the corresponding {opt variables} column. Users can specify any numeric multiplier in this column. The default is an multiplier of {opt 1.5} for the {opt iqr} method and {opt 3} for the {opt sd} method. 

{pstd}
{opt combine} column/variable indicates if variales specified in the corresponding {opt variables} column should be considered as 1 variable. eg. Assuming the survey has income values for household members stored in 4 different variables {cmd:hhm_income_1}, {cmd:hhm_income_2}, {cmd:hhm_income_3} and {cmd:hhm_income_4}; the {opt combine} column can be used to indicate that thee variables should be considered as the same when calculating the summary statistics required to flag outliers. Users can combine variables by indicating {cmd:"yes"} in the combine column. The default behaviour is to consider each variable specified in the {cmd:variables} column as individual variables. 

{pstd}
{opt keepvars} column/variable indicates the additional variables to export to the {opt outfile} sheet. 

{pstd}
{cmd:ipacheckoutliers} is one of the checks run in IPA's Data Management System. 
It can be run within IPA's Data Management System, where inputs are entered into a globals do-file 
and outputs are formatted in a .xlsx file or used directly from the command window or other do-files. See {help ipacheck} for more details on how to use the Data Management System.
